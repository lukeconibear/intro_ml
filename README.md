## Content

Machine learning and deep learning are very large, growing, and rapidly changing fields. They are a range of methods that learn associations from data. These can be useful for a range of problems. This course is a simple introduction to them. It aims to provide high-level, practical guidance to get started. This can help you build intuitions and make good practices a habit.

## Objectives

At the end of this workshop, learners will:

1. [ ] Understand the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning.
2. [ ] Know how to use key tools, including:
    - [ ] [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
    - [ ] [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/)
    - [ ] [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/)
3. [ ] Be aware of good practices for data, such as pipelines and modules.
4. [ ] Be aware of good practices for models, such as hyperparameter tuning, transfer learning, and callbacks.
5. [ ] Be able to undertake distributed training.
