# Summary

In this workshop, we covered:

```{admonition} 1. Understand the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning.

- [x] _Machine learning and deep learning are a range of prediction methods that learn associations from training data._
- [x] _The objective is for the models to generalise to new data._
- [x] _They mainly use tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) as inputs._
- [x] _Problems are mainly either supervised (if you provide labels) or unsupervised (if you don't provide labels)._
- [x] _Problems are either classification (if you're trying to predict a discrete category) or regression (if you're trying to predict a continuous number)._
- [x] _Data is split into training, validation, and test sets._
- [x] _The models only learn from the training data._
- [x] _The test set is used only once._
- [x] _Hyperparameters are set before model training._
- [x] _Parameters (i.e., the weights and biases) are learnt during model training._
- [x] _The aim is to minimise the loss function._
- [x] _The model underfits when it has high bias._
- [x] _The model overfits when it has high variance._

```


```{admonition} 2. Know how to use key tools, including:

- [x] [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

- [x] [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/)
    - [x] _..._
- [x] [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/)
    - [x] _..._

```
